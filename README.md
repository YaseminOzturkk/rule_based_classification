# Calculating Potential Customer Return with Rule-Based Classification
## Rule Based Classification
Rule-based classification is an approach for categorizing data within a dataset by applying predefined rules. This method involves creating specific rules to classify the data, and then sorting the data according to these rules.

Rule-based classification is typically a straightforward and efficient technique. It operates on predetermined rules, and the classification outcomes are determined by adhering to these rules. As a result, rule-based classification can prove to be particularly useful, especially when dealing with small datasets.
